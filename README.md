This Python script fetches user data (name, address, phone, and email) from a public API and exports it to a CSV file named `user_data.csv`.
To use this script, ensure Python and pip are installed.
Install the required packages using `pip install requests pandas`, then run the script with `python1_csv.py`.
The generated CSV file will contain user information formatted for easy use.
